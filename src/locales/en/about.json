    "painPoints": [
      "Cook everyday food that was both healthy and genuinely tasty",
      "Decide <1>every single day</1> what to make for breakfast, lunch, and dinner",

      "Watch good food go to waste in the fridge",
      "Keep a realistic, predictable food budget",
      "Find something flexible and simple enough to survive a busy week"

    "tried": "We tried spreadsheets, recipe apps, notes in our phones… nothing really stuck. Either it was too rigid, too manual, or it didn't understand our families, our budget, and our habits.",
    "built": "So we built <1>9 Meals</1> — for ourselves first, as a real tool to make family life calmer, cheaper, and more delicious. And now we're opening it up so you can use it too."

      "The app generates a <1>smart grocery list</1>, grouped by category, with quantity per product",
      "We shop once, often in our local supermarket, and know roughly what the week will cost",
      "During the week, we <1>eat what we feel like that day</1> — breakfast, lunch, or dinner — or skip a meal if we go out"

    "learning": "Because 9 Meals <1>learns your taste over time</1>, each new meal set becomes closer to what your family actually loves to eat. You keep your favourites, you remove what doesn't work, and the AI quietly adapts in the background.",
